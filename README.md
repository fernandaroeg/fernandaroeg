### Hi, Iâ€™m Fernanda ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Robotics and AI Engineer with 5+ years of experience developing software for localization systems, sensor fusion, and AI model alignment. My current focus is on human feedback data for LLMs â€” designing prompts, annotating responses, and evaluating AI behavior in complex technical domains.

#### ðŸŒŸ What I work on:
- Large Language Model alignment via RLHF and prompt design
- Robotics software (ROS, localization, sensor fusion)
- Embedded algorithms (C/C++)
- Data analysis (Python)

#### ðŸ§  Featured Projects:
- `llm-human-feedback-coding-eval`: Evaluation suite for LLM coding tasks
- `amcl_hybrid`: Indoor robot localization with AMCL + sensor fusion
- `rodaad`: ROS nodes to transform data available in public robotic datasets to ROS compatible format

Letâ€™s connect!
